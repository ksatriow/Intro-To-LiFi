# Intro To LiFi (Light Fidelity)
This repository provide practical documentation using LiFi
LiFi is a Visible Light Communications system transmitting wireless internet communications at very high speeds. LiFi is a wireless technology holds the key to solving challenges faced by 5G. LiFi can transmit at multiple gigabits, is more reliable, virtually interference free and uniquely more secure than radio technology such as Wi-Fi or cellular. (https://purelifi.com/lifi-technology/)

This project allows you to practice ESP32 for all **Microcontroller**. It can be used as an alternative to `Premium Course` and offers useful features and customization using sensor.

It has been written **100% in C**. ❤️

Transfer Audio using LiFi Project (Not yet documented, Still on IEEE review)


# Protocol
IoT communication protocols are modes of communication that protect and ensure optimum security to the data being exchanged between connected devices. The IoT devices are typically connected to the Internet via an IP (Internet Protocol) network. (https://www.kelltontech.com/kellton-tech-blog/internet-of-things-protocols-standards)

## LiFi
LiFi is a wireless technology holds the key to solving challenges faced by 5G. LiFi can transmit at multiple gigabits, is more reliable, virtually interference free and uniquely more secure than radio technology such as Wi-Fi or cellular. LiFi is a mobile wireless technology that uses light rather than radio frequencies to transmit data. The technology is supported by a global ecosystem of companies driving the adoption of LiFi, the next generation of wireless that is ready for seamless integration into the 5G core.
